Central to our design was a focus on advanced obstacle detection and avoidance, ensuring both safety and efficiency for the user.\nLeveraging the power of ROS (Robot Operating System), our approach involved a two-step process for obstacle management. Recognizing that not all objects detected are genuine obstacles, we first integrated computer vision to differentiate between potential barriers and harmless objects. This classification was crucial to avoid unnecessary diversions and conserve energy.\nTo complement this, we utilized ROS’s SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) capabilities for precise distance measurement between the bot and identified obstacles. By employing this sophisticated system, we could guide users smoothly around real obstructions while ignoring irrelevant items.\nOur system’s intelligence was housed in a microcomputer, chosen for its rapid data processing capabilities.
