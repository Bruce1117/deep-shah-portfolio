We targeted our product and research towards individuals and groups who loved nature camping and hiking, by focusing on solving the shortcomings of current market products by narrowing down and analysing the problem opportunity gap.\nEmbarking on the AquaLux project, my team and I were motivated by a single vision: to innovate water filtration for outdoor enthusiasts. Our journey began with meticulous user research, gathering data through surveys and direct observations to understand the real-world needs and limitations of current water filtration systems. This phase was crucial, revealing a spectrum of user requirements and preferences which became the backbone of our design parameters.\nIn developing AquaLux, my team and I aimed to redefine outdoor water filtration. My involvement began with conducting surveys and observations to pinpoint user needs, which informed the foundation of our design. I contributed to generating a myriad of concepts, later refined through collaborative brainstorming. I also lead the development of an exhaustive google survey which helped us choose our direction of development and focus in the early stages of the product ideation.\nThe next crucial step was identifying our main market competitors, and finding their shortcomings that could be addressed through our product evolution. This required intensive research and deep dive into their user reviews and recommendations. I then charted out the VOA charts for our competitors, which helped us gain better insights while making the VOA chart for our own product.\nNext, we were each tasked with generating 10 concepts individually and then evolving and combining these ideas to come up with an almost final concept that we could then start developing through an exhaustive iteration of rapiud prototyping and user validation.\nThrough mind mapping, we prioritized key features, and using dot voting and a weighted matrix, we pinpointed the top concepts. Prototyping was hands-on; I contributed to creating models ranging from rudimentary to advanced, each iteration informed by direct feedback from outdoor enthusiasts.

Lack of segregation, collection and transportation of unsegregated mixed waste to the landfills has an impact on the environment. When we segregate waste, it reduces the amount of waste that reaches landfills, thereby taking up less space. Pollution of air and water can be considerably reduced when hazardous waste is separated and treated separately. It is essential that waste is put in separate bins so that it can be appropriately dealt with. Hence, we made a 3-DOF robotic manipulator that will help segregate magnetic waste on garbage landfill sites by picking up magnetic waste from the incoming conveyor belt so that it does not go on for further processing along with the other recyclable waste and cause pollution in the environment.\nMobile Surveillance Robot In this project, my focus was on exploring the capabilities of ROS (Robot Operating System) for practical robotics applications. Utilizing ROS\u0026rsquo;s flexible framework, I successfully integrated Lidar and a webcam for real-time video feedback on the robot. This setup was complemented by a robust remote control system, established through a Master-Slave configuration between the robot and my base computer.\nThe core of the robot\u0026rsquo;s mobility was managed via the ‘/cmd_vel’ topic, with the base station transmitting velocity commands that the robot subscribed to. I harnessed the ‘rosserial_python’ package to bridge ROS with an Arduino Mega, translating these commands into PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) signals to drive the DC motors.\nFor visual feedback, I implemented the ‘video_streamer_opencv’ package within ROS, enabling live video streaming capabilities. Additionally, the project included sophisticated indoor mapping functionalities. By integrating ‘rplidar_ros’, ‘hector_slam’, and ‘map_server’ packages, I was able to generate and store detailed maps of indoor environments, showcasing the full extent of ROS\u0026rsquo;s versatile applications in robotics.\nRemote-Controlled Aerial Surveillance Drone Together with two other friends, I embarked on a project to delve into the intricacies of drone technology. Our goal was to custom-build a tele-operated surveillance drone, tailored for outdoor monitoring. This collaborative effort was driven by our shared curiosity to explore the various aspects and capabilities of drone engineering.\n","permalink":"https://eclectic-kangaroo-a38b71.netlify.app/undergrad_projects/","summary":"undergrad_projects","title":"Undergrad Projects"}]
