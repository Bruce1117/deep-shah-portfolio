## Roboticist | Software Enthusiast | F1 Fanatic

Technology has automated and eased into our lives as a dependent shoulder. From self-driving cars to home robotic machines, we are accosted and comforted by our need for technology in the smooth execution of our daily tasks. Amongst the varied technologies, Robotics in particular has always piqued my interest. I believe that great things can only be achieved through the collaborative efforts of like minds. As such, I envision myself on an entrepreneurial track, inspired by the endeavors of visionaries such as Elon Musk and Steve Jobs, to revolutionize the field of robotics and UAVs through autonomy and AI.

At my heart, I am a roboticist with experience in Motion planning and Autonomous navigation, Advanced control systems, System Integration and design and Rapid prototyping,. Excellent analytical, problem-solving, communication, team and leadership skills with strong numeracy and sense of urgency.

# Flytbase Labs
 
### Robotics Engineer | June 2022 - June 2023

As a Robotics Engineer at Flytbase Labs, a leading drone autonomy service provider in San Jose, California, I played a pivotal role in advancing drone technology. My expertise in software programming and modular testing was instrumental in enhancing algorithm scalability and reusability. I led the development of vital features, such as precise drone ETA calculations and the creation of a global drone monitoring and control system. A highlight of my tenure was spearheading a major technical initiative to integrate an autonomous commercial collision avoidance system with an Unmanned Aircraft Traffic Management (UTM) system, significantly elevating operational safety standards for unmanned aerial systems. My leadership extended to directing a team of six engineers in architecting a Python-based async microservices codebase, contributing to a scalable platform capable of supporting up to 1 million users globally. Additionally, I successfully built and managed VPC networks on AWS, increasing drone simulation system efficiency by 80%. My work also included developing an advanced wrapper for the DJI SDK, facilitating autonomous UAV operations in over 25 countries, and incorporating ADS-B monitoring with FlytNow dashboard APIs. This experience solidified my ability to handle enterprise-scale projects and drive technological innovation in unmanned aerial systems.
