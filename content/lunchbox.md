Raised in a family that valued hard work, academic achievement, and societal welfare, I learned the importance of community and accessibility to life's basic necessities from a young age. My upbringing, grounded in these values, shaped my response to the global pandemic, particularly in recognizing my own privileges.

During the pandemic, as many struggled for daily sustenance, I was fortunate to be safe and well-provided for. This stark contrast prompted me to engage in meaningful social work, leading me to join "The Lunchbox Project India." At this NGO, we focused on bridging the gap between those in dire need of food and COVID relief food providers. Our primary tool was a website that connected quarantined individuals, families, and the homeless with home chefs and other credible food service providers.

My role involved extensive collaboration with various NGOs across India, ensuring the reliability and verification of service providers listed on our platform. This work wasn't just about logistics; it was a deeply humbling journey, opening my eyes to the profound impact of collective small efforts in challenging times.

One of the most memorable experiences during my time with the NGO was participating in a campaign celebrating Pride Month with the LGBTQ+ community in Chennai. Here, I discovered a unique way to contribute â€“ through beatboxing. Performing live for the community was an exhilarating experience that underscored the joy and unity music can bring, even in the most trying circumstances.

This period of volunteering not only allowed me to contribute to the welfare of others but also enriched my life, offering a deeper understanding of empathy, community service, and the power of collective action.
